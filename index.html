          <h3>Why Austin?</h3>
          <h2>Austin, home of the Texas Longhorns</h2>
          <p>
            Austin is the capital city of the U.S. state of Texas, as well as
            the seat and largest city of Travis County, with portions extending
            into Hays and Williamson counties. It has been one of the fastest
            growing large cities in the United States since 2010. Downtown
            Austin and Downtown San Antonio are approximately 80 miles (129 km)
            apart, and both fall along the Interstate 35 corridor. Some
            observers believe that the two regions may some day form a new
            "metroplex" similar to Dallas and Fort Worth. Austin is the
            southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States and is
            considered a "Beta âˆ’" global city as categorized by the
            Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p>
            While I may eventually venture into University of Texas-Austin as a
            student, for now I live adjacent to Austin and simply visit on
            occasion. The university has a strong pull, and is a big draw for
            many to make it to Austin, as well as the ever-charming El Arroyo
            restaurant!
